### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm developing mostly Internet Standards covered software.

Late in 2015 I developed and until now continue to maintain and improve certified libraries to help developers consume OpenID Connect and OAuth 2 services. I strive to implement as many optional features as possible as well as implement early specification drafts to aid in interoperability testing and provide implementer's feedback back to IETF and OpenID Foundation as early and frequently as possible.

Support from the community to continue maintaining and improving these modules is welcome. If you find my modules useful, please consider supporting the projects by [becoming a sponsor ðŸ’—](https://github.com/sponsors/panva).
