### Hi there 👋

I'm developing software related to Internet Standards.

Since late 2015, I have been developing, maintaining, and improving certified libraries to help developers utilize OpenID Connect and OAuth 2 services. I strive to implement as many optional features as possible and adopt early specification drafts to aid in interoperability testing. This allows me to provide implementer feedback to the Working Groups at IETF, OpenID Foundation, and W3C as early and frequently as possible.

Community support is crucial for the continued maintenance and improvement of these modules. If you find my modules useful, please consider [becoming a sponsor 💗](https://github.com/sponsors/panva).
