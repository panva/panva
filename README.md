### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm developing mostly Internet Standards covered software.

Late in 2015 I developed and until now continue to maintain and improve [certified](https://openid.net/certification/) libraries to help developers consume OpenID Connect and OAuth 2 services. I strive to implement as many optional features as possible as well as implement early specification drafts to aid in interoperability testing and provide implementer's feedback back to IETF and OpenID Foundation as early and frequently as possible.

If you or your company rely on my software, please consider supporting me, so that this software continues being the best supported and feature-complete one out there.
